<!-- 
    <div> -  It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.
          -  HTML Content Division element
          -  Should be used only when no other semantic element (such
             as <article> or <nav>) is appropriate.
    
    <span> - generic inline container for phrasing content,
             which does not inherently represent anything.

-->

<!-- Both can be used to group elements for styling purposes, common attributes.
<div> is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline element.-->
